Adapting voyage
Sweetest taste now look for more
Eyes dart in silence
Winds blow without care
One last step after sun sets
Chasing of the end
Dreaming in my mind
Harmonies until you're back
Flags drift all alone
Fish swim from the East
Racing mind collapsing slow
Nature grows weary
Grass grows with relief
Nature's grasp inside my mind
Earth covers softly
Fall reaching lightly
Last farewell drinks life's essence
Appeal of wonder
Rewards at the sea
Gift of life inside my mind
Grimace of fortune
Sun shines bright cheerful
Bird of prey is hypnotized
Rewards of refuge
Caress of fortune
Naked skin bathing in light
Drinks shared gladly
